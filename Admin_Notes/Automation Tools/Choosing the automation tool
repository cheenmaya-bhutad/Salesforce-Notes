An automation tool in saleforce is used to configure the internal process to be automated to save time across the orgs.

In order to determine which tool we should use depends on the business process to be automated.

Different type of automation tools in saleforce are - 
workflow ---> workflow rules
process builders ---> processes
flow builders ---> flows 
approval processes ---> apporvals

General types for business process :-
1) Getting the approval for a process - When we require an approval for a process in salesforce we can use approval process.

2) Perform some process based on data of salesforce - When we have to automate a process which should be triggered based on criteria on the data in the salesforce then we can use 
process builders, workflows and flow builders.
In increasing range of complexity of business process the tools to be used are -> workflows -> process builders -> flow builders

3) Taking the input from users for the process - Flow builder is the most useful tool for this case. Here we can create a flow that takes the user through different screens or record page screens to take the user input.
Example: Call script for salespersons.
