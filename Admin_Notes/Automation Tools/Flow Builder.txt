Flow Builder :- 
Flow builder is the tool present in the salesforce flow product to create flows.
Flow is an application which can take input from user, call apex methods, perfrom some logic and interact with database.

Components of Flows:
Elements -> Individual components of flow.
Connectors -> Connector allows us to connect the elements in the flow and decide the path the flow follow at runtime.
Resources -> This are the containers to store the values which we can reference later in the flow.

Components of Flow Builder:
Canvas -> Where the flow is created in the visual form.
Toolbox -> Where we can find the elements, resources to be added in the flow.
Action bar -> Where we can check status of flow, activate it other actions such cut and copy elements

Types of elements:
Screen element -> This element allows us to create a way to take user input. We can either add standard buttons or create a lightning component for custom input format.
Example -> For sales people we create a call script that takes user through multiple screens to take various types of input.

Logic element -> This element allows us to perform logic operations, loop through records, make decisions based on record data and more.

Action element -> This element allows us to perform various operations such crud and we can also call apex code when in case of custom action which is not covered by flow builder.

Integration elements -> Integration elements allow us to connect to external database system with core actions or apex actions.

User permissions for flows:
Run flows -> allows the user to run flows.
Manage flows -> allows user with this permission to run inactive flows.

Notes - Flow interview refers to running instance of flow. Each user interacts with individual instances of the flow.
