--> We can change the labels for tabs in standard objects using rename tabs and labels option.

--> Lookup filters limit the records available in lookup. 
    This filter are specific to lookup relationship fields.
    Lookup filters can search other fields on current reecord,fields on target object(lookup object), on records directly related to the target object record,user records fields as well.
Example:
    Consider case object record. This has a field Contact name which indicates lookup relationship with Contact Object. Also we can associate a case with Account using the lookup relation field. So here using the condition in lookup filter as 
                    Condition Name : AccountId equals Case : AccountId (The account Id for the contact asscoiated with the case) 
    limits the contact now which can be assigned to the case to those which have account same as the account to which the case belongs.

--> Record types are used to determine which business processes, page layouts and picklist values are available to users.
